# DemoData SQL tools. Wrappers for the [DemoTools](https://github.com/timriffe/DemoTools) package to work with UNPD SQL data format.

Date: 2018-12-13

This package is a seed at this time and will begin active development very soon. This project is commissioned by the [UN Population Division](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/) and financed by the [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) as part of the [Making Family Planning Count](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/projects/making-family-planning-count/index.shtml) project. Work is also done in collaboration with [Marius Pascariu](http://findresearcher.sdu.dk/portal/en/persons/marius-pascariu(f77ff3a9-476f-4a40-ae73-403ceaaef233).html).

If you detect a bug or have a suggestion please notify us using the [Issues](https://github.com/timriffe/DDSQLtools/issues) tab on github. Even better if you fix it and make a pull request! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/timriffe/DDSQLtools/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more tips on reporting bugs or offering patches.

You can load the ```DDSQLtools``` package in R like so:
```r
# install.packages("devtools")

library(devtools)
install_github("timriffe/DDSQLtools")
```
(if either of the first two icons at the top of this README are red, then this might not be working at the moment. You can assume we're fixing it. If they're green, then it'll probably work.)

If you are a random visiting demographer then you probably would rather check out the [DemoTools](https://github.com/timriffe/DemoTools) package.
